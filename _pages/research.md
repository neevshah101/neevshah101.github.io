My broad research interests are in massive (and binary) star evolution. I am interested in understanding the formation of various classes of systems that we see in the universe, ranging from X-ray binaries, Gravitational Wave events, supernovae etc. In the past I have also worked on topics in population studies of gravitational wave sources, gravitational wave lensing, self interacting dark matter, and finding black holes orbiting luminous companions using TESS.
