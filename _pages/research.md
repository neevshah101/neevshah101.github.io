My broad research interests are in massive (and binary) star evolution. I am interested in understanding the formation of various classes of systems that we see in the universe, ranging from X-ray binaries, Gravitational Wave events, supernovae etc. In the past I have also worked on topics in population studies of gravitational wave sources, gravitational wave lensing, self interacting dark matter, and finding black holes orbiting luminous companions using TESS.

1) Lensing of Gravitational Waves
    > I worked on developing a method to evaluate and include the effects of lensing in population studies of GW sources. This was my Master's project that I completed at ICTS, Bengaluru under the supervision of Parameswaran Ajith. [[ASI Poster Abstract](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024asi..confP.109S/abstract)]

2) Self-Interacting Dark Matter Halos
    > At IISER Pune, I worked with Susmita Adhikari on observational consequences of SIDM, particularly in evaluating the tendency of SIDM halos to undergo core-collapse. [[MNRAS](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/529/4/4611/7633967?login=false), [arXiv:2308.16342](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16342)]

3) Gravitational Wave Signal vs Glitch Classifier
    > In the summer of 2022, I was awarded a MITACS Globalink Research Internship to work with Jess McIver at UBC Vancouver. I developed a new random forest classifier to distinguish between gravitational wave signals and transient detector noises called glitches.

4) Finding Black Holes orbiting Luminous Companions in the Milky Way with TESS
    > I worked with Sourav Chatterjee at TIFR, Mumbai to use binary population synthesis simulations to determine how many black holes orbiting stars in the Galaxy could be detected via TESS light curves. [[ApJ](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad7b0b), [arXiv:2310.16891](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16891)]
