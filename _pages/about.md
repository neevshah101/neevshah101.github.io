I am currently a second year Astronomy PhD Student at Steward Observatory, The University of Arizona. I work with Mathieu Renzo on various aspects of massive stars in binaries, aiming to understand how they lead to a wide range of phenomenon, ranging from X-ray binaries to Gravitational Wave sources. I completed my undergraduate and masters at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune, and I am originally from the coastal city of Mumbai.

Outside research, I generally like to do things that keep me active. Currently, my main interests are running and bouldering, but I also love hiking, watching movies, reading books (mostly fiction), and playing board games.
